Threat Intelligence Aggregator 


Perfect — that Threat Intelligence Aggregator concept is a very high-leverage, 
fast-to-market play that aligns with your goals:
Ownership & scalability 
Technical defensibility via AI/NLP/data fusion 
Recurring income via B2B SaaS or licensing 
Fast MVP cycle with data feed + basic UX 
Clear value to MSSPs, SOC teams, vCISOs

Let’s reconstruct and sharpen that idea into a tactical plan:

⸻

 Product Concept: AI-Powered Threat Intel Aggregator (MVP v0.1)

One-liner:

“Real-time, noise-reduced threat intelligence from 30+ sources, scored and 
tagged for your SOC in one feed.”

⸻

 Target Users

•
•
•

MSSPs / SOC Analysts (Tier 1–3)
Solo vCISOs or fractional CISOs
Small-medium security teams drowning in raw CTI feeds

⸻

 Problem (Validation from the field)

Threat intel feeds are noisy, duplicative, unactionable.

1.
2. No centralized, auto-prioritized view across free/paid feeds (AlienVault, 

Twitter, CISA, etc.).

3.

Smaller MSSPs can’t afford dedicated CTI analysts.

⸻

 MVP Features (2–4 weeks buildable)

•
•
•
•

Aggregates 10–30 public CTI sources (RSS, API, scraping)
Auto-dedupe & normalize IOCs (via hashing, entity linking)
Score threat severity (basic NLP + rule-based scoring)
Classify by TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK mapping v0)

 Build Fast Strategy

1. Week 1: Set up scraper + enrichment pipeline
2. Week 2: Score/severity + MVP front-end (even barebones)
3. Week 3–4: Export formats, Slack/email alerts, start pitching MSSPs
Validation: Offer free access to 5 SOC contacts in exchange for 
4.
